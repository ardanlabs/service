	// may be converted to this error.

	// that are problematic regardless of the state of the system
	// (e.g., a malformed file name).
	InvalidArgument ErrCode = 3

	// DeadlineExceeded means operation expired before completion.
	// For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be

	// long enough for the deadline to expire.

	// AlreadyExists means an attempt to create an entity failed because one
	// already exists.

	// PermissionDenied indicates the caller does not have permission to
	// execute the specified operation. It must not be used for rejections
	// caused by exhausting some resource (use ResourceExhausted
	// instead for those errors). It must not be
	// used if the caller cannot be identified (use Unauthenticated
	// instead for those errors).
	PermissionDenied ErrCode = 7

	// ResourceExhausted indicates some resource has been exhausted, perhaps
	// a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space.
	ResourceExhausted ErrCode = 8

	// FailedPrecondition indicates operation was rejected because the
	// system is not in a state required for the operation's execution.
	// For example, directory to be deleted may be non-empty, an rmdir
	// operation is applied to a non-directory, etc.
	FailedPrecondition ErrCode = 9

	// Aborted indicates the operation was aborted, typically due to a
	// concurrency issue like sequencer check failures, transaction aborts,
	// etc.
	Aborted ErrCode = 10

	// OutOfRange means operation was attempted past the valid range.
	// E.g., seeking or reading past end of file.
	//
	// Unlike InvalidArgument, this error indicates a problem that may
	// be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file
	// system will generate InvalidArgument if asked to read at an
	// offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
	// OutOfRange if asked to read from an offset past the current
	// file size.
	//
	// There is a fair bit of overlap between FailedPrecondition and
	// OutOfRange. We recommend using OutOfRange (the more specific
	// error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through
	// a space can easily look for an OutOfRange error to detect when
	// they are done.

	// Unimplemented indicates operation is not implemented or not
	// supported/enabled in this service.

	// Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by underlying
	// system has been broken. If you see one of these errors,
	// something is very broken.
	Internal ErrCode = 13

	// Unavailable indicates the service is currently unavailable.
	// This is a most likely a transient condition and may be corrected
	// by retrying with a backoff. Note that it is not always safe to retry
	// non-idempotent operations.
	//
	// See litmus test above for deciding between FailedPrecondition,
	// Aborted, and Unavailable.
	Unavailable ErrCode = 14

	// DataLoss indicates unrecoverable data loss or corruption.
