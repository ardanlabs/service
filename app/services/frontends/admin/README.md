## To create the project we leverage the following template provided by the MUI Team

* [Material UI - Next.js App Router example in TypeScript](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/41f15df97b74bbf102715857564374551fac6162/examples/material-next-app-router-ts)

## The idea behind the example

The project uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), which is a framework for server-rendered React apps.
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction), the default style engine in Material UI v5. If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).
