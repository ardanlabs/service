	Canceled = ErrCode{value: 2}

	// Unknown error. An example of where this error may be returned is
	// if a Status value received from another address space belongs to
	// an error-space that is not known in this address space. Also
	// errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information
	// may be converted to this error.
	Unknown = ErrCode{value: 3}

	// InvalidArgument indicates client specified an invalid argument.
	// Note that this differs from FailedPrecondition. It indicates arguments
	// that are problematic regardless of the state of the system
	// (e.g., a malformed file name).
	InvalidArgument = ErrCode{value: 4}

	// DeadlineExceeded means operation expired before completion.
	// For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be
	// returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For
	// example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed
	// long enough for the deadline to expire.

	// not found.
	NotFound = ErrCode{value: 6}

	// AlreadyExists means an attempt to create an entity failed because one
	// already exists.
	AlreadyExists = ErrCode{value: 7}

	// PermissionDenied indicates the caller does not have permission to
	// execute the specified operation. It must not be used for rejections
	// caused by exhausting some resource (use ResourceExhausted
	// instead for those errors). It must not be
	// used if the caller cannot be identified (use Unauthenticated
	// instead for those errors).
	PermissionDenied = ErrCode{value: 8}

	// ResourceExhausted indicates some resource has been exhausted, perhaps
	// a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space.
	ResourceExhausted = ErrCode{value: 9}

	// FailedPrecondition indicates operation was rejected because the
	// system is not in a state required for the operation's execution.
	// For example, directory to be deleted may be non-empty, an rmdir
	// operation is applied to a non-directory, etc.
	FailedPrecondition = ErrCode{value: 10}

	// Aborted indicates the operation was aborted, typically due to a
	// concurrency issue like sequencer check failures, transaction aborts,
	// etc.
	Aborted = ErrCode{value: 11}

	// OutOfRange means operation was attempted past the valid range.
	// E.g., seeking or reading past end of file.
	//
	// Unlike InvalidArgument, this error indicates a problem that may
	// be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file
	// system will generate InvalidArgument if asked to read at an
	// offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
	// OutOfRange if asked to read from an offset past the current
	// file size.
	//
	// There is a fair bit of overlap between FailedPrecondition and
	// OutOfRange. We recommend using OutOfRange (the more specific
	// error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through
	// a space can easily look for an OutOfRange error to detect when
	// they are done.
	OutOfRange = ErrCode{value: 12}

	// Unimplemented indicates operation is not implemented or not
	// supported/enabled in this service.
	Unimplemented = ErrCode{value: 13}

	// Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by underlying
	// system has been broken. If you see one of these errors,
	// something is very broken.
	Internal = ErrCode{value: 14}

	// Unavailable indicates the service is currently unavailable.
	// This is a most likely a transient condition and may be corrected
	// by retrying with a backoff. Note that it is not always safe to retry
	// non-idempotent operations.
	//
	// See litmus test above for deciding between FailedPrecondition,
	// Aborted, and Unavailable.
	Unavailable = ErrCode{value: 15}

	// DataLoss indicates unrecoverable data loss or corruption.
	DataLoss = ErrCode{value: 16}

	// Unauthenticated indicates the request does not have valid
	// authentication credentials for the operation.
	Unauthenticated = ErrCode{value: 17}
