# The sales pod will act as the ops person for initializing Vault and loading
# the RSA private key into vault. This will allow vault to run inside the cluster
# for dev purposes. Initializing Vault has to happen before this service starts.
# Normally Vault would run outside the cluster and already be avalable with the
# RSA private keys we are using.
