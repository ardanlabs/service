## Description

_"As a program evolves and acquires more features, it becomes complicated, with subtle dependencies between components. Over time, complexity accumulates, and it becomes harder and harder for programmers to keep all the relevant factors in their minds as they modify the system. This slows down development and leads to bugs, which slow development even more and add to its cost. Complexity increases inevitably over the life of any program. The larger the program, and the more people that work on it, the more difficult it is to manage complexity."_ - John Ousterhout  

The service starter kit is a starting point for building production grade scalable web service applications that leverage the power of a Domain Driven, Data Oriented Architecture that can run in Kubernetes. The goal of this project is to provide a proven starting point that reduces the repetitive tasks required for a new project to be launched into production. It uses minimal dependencies, implements idiomatic code and follows Go best practices. Collectively, the project lays out everything logically to minimize guess work and enable engineers to quickly maintain a mental model for the project.

The class behind this starter kit teaches how to build production-level software in Go leveraging the power of a Domain Driven, Data Oriented Architecture that can run in Kubernetes. From the beginning, you will pair program with the instructor walking through the design philosophies and guidelines for building software in Go. With each new feature that is added to the project, you will learn how to deploy to and manage the Kubernetes environment used to run the project. The core of this class is to teach you and your team how to handle and reduce the spread of complexity in the systems you are building.

## Installation

To clone the project, create a folder and use the git clone command. Then please read the [makefile](makefile) file to learn how to install all the tooling and docker images.

```
$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir code
$ cd code
$ git clone https://github.com/ardanlabs/service or git@github.com:ardanlabs/service.git
$ cd service
```

## Create Your Own Version

If you want to create a version of the project for your own use, use the new gonew command.

```
$ go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gonew@latest

$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir code
$ cd code
$ gonew github.com/ardanlabs/service github.com/mydomain/myproject
$ cd myproject
$ go mod vendor
```

Now you have a copy with your own module name. Now all you need to do is initialize the project for git.

## Purchase Video

The entire training class has been recorded to be made available to those who can't have the class taught at their company or who can't attend a conference. This is the entire class material.

## Our Experience

We have taught Go to thousands of developers all around the world since 2014. There is no other company that has been doing it longer and our material has proven to help jump-start developers 6 to 12 months ahead of their knowledge of Go. We know what knowledge developers need in order to be productive and efficient when writing software in Go.

Our classes are perfect for intermediate-level developers who have at least a few months to years of experience writing code in Go. Our classes provide a very deep knowledge of the programming langauge with a big push on language mechanics, design philosophies and guidelines. We focus on teaching how to write code with a priority on consistency, integrity, readability and simplicity. We cover a lot about “if performance matters” with a focus on mechanical sympathy, data oriented design, decoupling and writing/debugging production software.

## More About Go

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. Although it borrows ideas from existing languages, it has a unique and simple nature that make Go programs different in character from programs written in other languages. It balances the capabilities of a low-level systems language with some high-level features you see in modern languages today. This creates a programming environment that allows you to be incredibly productive, performant and fully in control; in Go, you can write less code and do so much more.

Go is the fusion of performance and productivity wrapped in a language that software developers can learn, use and understand. Go is not C, yet we have many of the benefits of C with the benefits of higher level programming languages.
