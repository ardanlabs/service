// served for the duration of the TTL even if an upstream system goes down. To
// use this functionality, you need to implement an interface with two
// additional methods for deleting records compared to the simpler
// "WithDistributedStorage" option. This is because a distributed cache that is
// used with this option might have low refresh durations but high TTLs. If a
// record is deleted from the underlying data source, it needs to be propagated
// to the distributed storage before the TTL expires. However, please note that
