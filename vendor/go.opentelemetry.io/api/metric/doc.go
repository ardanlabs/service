// metric package provides an API for reporting diagnostic
// measurements using three basic kinds of instruments (or four, if
// calling one special case a separate one).
//
// The three basic kinds are:
//
// - counters
// - gauges
// - measures
//
// All instruments report either float64 or int64 values.
//
// The primary object that handles metrics is Meter. The
// implementation of the Meter is provided by SDK. Normally, the Meter
// is used directly only for the LabelSet generation, batch recording
// and the handle destruction.
//
// LabelSet is a set of keys and values that are in a suitable,
// optimized form to be used by Meter.
//
// Counters are instruments that are reporting a quantity or a sum. An
// example could be bank account balance or bytes downloaded. Counters
// can be created with either NewFloat64Counter or
// NewInt64Counter. Counters expect non-negative values by default to
// be reported. This can be changed with the WithMonotonic option
// (passing false as a parameter) passed to the Meter.New*Counter
// function - this allows reporting negative values. To report the new
// value, use an Add function.
//
// Gauges are instruments that are reporting a current state of a
// value. An example could be voltage or temperature. Gauges can be
// created with either NewFloat64Gauge or NewInt64Gauge. Gauges by
// default have no limitations about reported values - they can be
// less or greater than the last reported value. This can be changed
// with the WithMonotonic option passed to the New*Gauge function -
// this permits the reported values only to go up. To report a new
// value, use the Set function.
//
// Measures are instruments that are reporting values that are
// recorded separately to figure out some statistical properties from
// those values (like average). An example could be temperature over
// time or lines of code in the project over time. Measures can be
// created with either NewFloat64Measure or NewInt64Measure. Measures
// by default take only non-negative values. This can be changed with
// the WithAbsolute option (passing false as a parameter) passed to
// the New*Measure function - this allows reporting negative values
// too. To report a new value, use the Record function.
//
// All the basic kinds of instruments also support creating handles
// for a potentially more efficient reporting. The handles have the
// same function names as the instruments (so counter handle has Add,
// gauge handle has Set and measure handle has Record). Handles can be
// created with the AcquireHandle function of the respective
// instrument. When done with the handle, call Release on it.
